# SONIC-Z-TREME
Sonic Z-Treme project for the Sega Saturn game console

SONIC Z-TREME v.0.0813 BY XL2

# SONIC RINGWORLDS
Sonic Ringworlds is a project built off of Sonic Z-Treme
the project is made to see whether Z-Treme can hold up a full fledged game and whether it has the capability of being optimized any more

SONIC RINGWORLDS v0.0004

# GPL license :

By making it Open source it might help the homebrew community.
Just don't be a jerk, just give me some credits somewhere if you use it.
Unless you fully remove Sonic, all audio/music/texture assets, SBL and SGL, you CAN'T sell it.
In other words, you can't sell this game.

# THIS PROJECT IS NOT APPROVED NOR SUPPORTED BY SEGA!

# Used libraries : 
Sega Basic Library and Sega Graphic Library.
Z-Treme Engine (older version)

# Credits : 
The compiler setup is very similar to the Jo Engine setup and it uses Johannes Fetz's cue maker. 
Props to Dany from Jo Engine forums for helping me setup the compiler environment.
The Sonic X-Treme maps are from Andrew75, the maker of Project AXSX.
Thanks to JollyRoger for his overall help and tips.
Thanks to Caf√© Alpha for the Satlink support.
Thanks also to the Segaxtreme community (vbt, mrkotfw and many others) who helped me a lot improving the Z-Treme engine 
(not seen here, the version in Sonic Z-Treme is an old one).

# To play the game [Z-Treme]:
If you are just looking at downloading the current "best" build of the game to try it, the Sage demo is better than this version (at least at the time I am writing this) : 
https://sonicfangameshq.com/forums/showcase/sonic-z-treme-saturn-sage-2018-demo.161/

# To play the game [Ringworlds]:
simply boot up a batch file that has the name of an emulator
if there is no file to play with, compile and you'll be on your way.

# To compile : 
Just run compile.bat to compile the code. I use Code::Blocks, but even notepad would work.

# Note on this code [XL2]: 
it's not pretty, I know!
I started this project with very little knowledge of coding, even less for game making.
So I am not a programmer and I never code in my job, but I learned a great deal thanks to this project.
Many things are wrong or could be much better.
I know it, but with little free time, I just wanted to make a nice little game, so I just tried to do it as fast as possible even knowing things are "broken" or not efficient.
Bad coding practices, yes, but at least a game quickly came out of it!

# A new note on the code [Birb64]:
the code still isn't as pretty.
I don't know if there is any better ways to program this stuff. Props to XL2 for helping us with Z-Treme as we move along.
I myself am not the most experienced programmer. Just looking at XL2's code taught me way more programming tricks that I never thought existed.
I'll do my best to optimize, shorten, and sharpen the code. This doesn't mean that the code will be much better than it already is
Ringworlds is planned to have a lot more content so it'll take longer than Z-Treme did.
That isn't to say that Z-Treme is not as good, in fact it's the foundation of Ringworlds. It's fun to use and I highly recommend to use it if you're not the most experienced programmer.

# Why Sonic X-Treme?[XL2]
I chose to remake Sonic X-Treme for a number of reason, the number one being the simplicity of it.
The blocky nature of the game made the collision detection easier when I started and it also made generating LOD models easy.
I am not a die-hard Sonic fan (I still haven't completed Sonic Mania...), so it wasn't a project I planned to work on, it just kind of happened more or less by accident.
I planned to do it as a real quick project and just make cheap maps looking kind of like Sonic X-Treme (the name "Sonic Z-Treme" was meant to be a joke, like a cheap ripoff).
My mindset for the game was "Just give me a D- already!", but with Andrew75 sharing is 3d models of the Sonic X-Treme maps, the project became more serious, so I invested more time in it and started to work on a model/map converter, I then added collision detection generation using the converter, and then kept on adding more features... so the project quickly overtook the released demos we had of Sonic X-Treme and went beyond what I thought I would/could do.

# A thank you
Had it not been for you choosing sonic X=Treme as a recreation, Ringworlds would have never had much of a good engine to work with. 
We were originally working with Unity and it's not the best to use if you're working on a game with complicated angles. 
Though this means I'm mostly gonna be using someone else's code(something I'd usually not like as much to do) I still trust that this code is way better than what I could do in Unity
thank you XL2

I lost motivation on this project for a number of reason, the number one being the insane amount of people complaining non-stop without even playing the demo.

"I refuse to play this unless you put sprites!" 
"Port Sonic Mania instead! Do I have to do it myself?"
"Where is the fisheye lens?"
"Can you make game XYZ instead?"
"There is a reason Sega cancelled Sonic X-Treme!"
"Mario 64/Crash is much better!"
"It's so blocky! LOL!"

It got to a point where people were just complaining non-stop, and the more features I added the more people complained/requested stuff, so it just frustrated me a lot and fully killed my motivation to work on this.
Considering that it's not the project I wanted to do and realizing that I was just putting way too much of my free time in something not pleasing anybody (or almost), I just killed this project. 
I am now writing a FPS game for the Saturn (which will take forever to complete), so I just release Sonic Z-Treme as-is in case someone wants to play with it/improve it or pick it up.

# The surgery[Birb64]
"I refuse to play this unless you put sprites!" 
this won't be fixed, however it will be compensated by a simple answer: project condor. Since Ringworlds is a mashup style of game, it mashes all the sonic X-Treme protos, including project condor. So that will be the answer to that issue
"Port Sonic Mania instead! Do I have to do it myself?"
There isn't a reason to port sonic mania to saturn, however if you did want to port it DIY, just use JoEngine. As I've heard, JoEngine is used for 2D games. You could use the code from this project/sonic Z-Treme and have the physics work according to sonic Z-Treme
"Where is the fisheye lens?"
no.
"Can you make game XYZ instead?"
I don't have much to say here, I don't know what this means. So, no?
"There is a reason Sega cancelled Sonic X-Treme!"
don't worry, me and the Ringworlds team have figured out what made sonic X-Treme so poor and have found a multitude of ways to fix every problem whilst also keeping the functionalities of those fixes(one way we did this is we took out the fisheye lens and replaced it with a nice 45 degree angle change in camera)
"Mario 64/Crash is much better!"
Z-Treme wasn't fully completed, as it was a simple, yet effective and ambitious, project. Ringworlds is planned to be more complete and with tons more to do.
"It's so blocky! LOL!"
I can't say much to this, as sonic Ringworlds is still a bit blocky, however, it's blocky in a way that makes it more akin to super mario 3D world in a way

No matter what you say, I think this project will go nicely if the Ringworlds team can keep up

# Note on this build [XL2]: 
it was rushed for SAGE 2018. I had no working build in 2018 and wanted to try a new engine using octrees.
I also wrote a custom vertex animation system, which I was proud of (done from scratch in like 2 weeks part time, I was very pleased with the results even if it's not user friendly).

THIS VERSION IS POST-SAGE : I did many experiments, so it's not as good as the Sage version. 
Performances are worse, both because I didn't update the map compiler to support my newer frustum culling function and because I use gouraud shading instead of flat lighting.
I also decreased the z scaling, so more polygons are shown on screen. 
I built a BSP compiler that I used for lighting, which worked well, but killed support for some maps, which is why it has less maps than the Sage demo.

# A new note on this build [Birb64]:
this version isn't as rushed as Z-Treme. We in the Ringworlds team are taking our time very leisurely, as we don't want to have this project effect our lives too negatively.

# About the map compiler [XL2]: 
It truly sucks. 
I won't share it for now, I would need to clean it quite a bit, but it really sucks. It started as simple model converter to a collision generator to a "full" map compiler. And I did so many experiments, so many different iterations of the engine that it's a real shitshow of unused code, abandonned experiments, working experiments with terrible code, duplicate functions, etc.
In other words, it's terrible even to myself, so I won't share it for now. I would need to update it as well to fix things I broke since SAGE and make sure it works with the current Z-Treme build, but it takes more time than I am willing to spend for now. 
If there is enough interest, I will try to find time to fix it.

# About the map compiler 2 [Birb64]:
XL2 didn't give us much info on the map compiler
He did say that he would lend us a copy of it once he got it working enough.
We here down at Ringworlds can't wait to see the map compiler, mapping has been a huge thing since we've started in unity.

# A reqiuem to the unity ringworlds
The unity version of ringworlds was all over the place. I was the only one programming and I wanted the physics to be perfect. 
It took us 2 months before we had normal wall collision. Even then, the wall collision was terrible and not finished. 
The thing that stands out from Z-Treme is that it had a map maker and planned modding capabilities.
We had a map maker which saved in .xtra files(since ringworlds was originally xtraordinary) the map maker's name was SS.PC.
Fully capable of making blocks, and 45 degree slopes with differently textured sides.
Everyone, including I, enjoyed it quite a lot.
It was fun, simple, and effective.
I'm hoping I can get a hold of XL2's map maker source code. 
So that I might be able to make a mod for blender that would add icons and such to the game that would export to the map file.
I'm also hoping to make those icons as fun as they were in the SS.PC.
Anyways, that was a reqiuem of unity ringworlds.

# The future
When this game finally releases, I'm gonna be going off and becoming an engineer.
It's definitely gonna be a gradual change, but none-the-less, I plan to leave this project as soon as it's perfectly enjoyable to audiences around the hemispheres
